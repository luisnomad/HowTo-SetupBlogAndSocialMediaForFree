## How To Setup your Blog (and supporting Social Media accounts) For Free

This is a small but complete tutorial for those who want to create content and are interested in having an Internet presence. Whether you want to be found because you're selling something, or because you want to market yourself, there is no doubt that one mandatory step is to be active on Social Media, and create original content. You can write about your ideas, your professional experience and show your porfolio and products, and the easiest way to do that is having a website. Maybe it doesn't make sense to you to have a full blown web with pages and sections, so a blog is more fit to your goals.

If you don't know where to start, this tutorial will guide you through the whole process, step by step. By the time you have finished following these instructions, you'll have more than enough to start building your brand (personal or professional). 

Examples of blogs you can create:

* Personal blog
* Blog about your favorite topic: travelling, food, photography, movies, music, lifestyle, fashion, relationships, etc
* Promote your company and your products
* Product reviews

So let's start with a basic checklist of all the stuff I will cover. You don't need all of it, but since (almost) everything is for free, why not adding it? Of course, if it doesn't make sense to you, just ignore some of the tools/services I am suggesting. But don't do it because "you don't have the time" to maintain it all active and working. This is a one time setup, and we'll add some automation to connect all the dots. So whenever you create content, it will spread across your network, without effort. Actually, without doing anything at all! Don't be scared, it's SUPER easy to achieve this. You don't need any technical knowledge whatsoever to complete this guide.

## What will you have after finishing all the steps?

* [ ] Blog with..
  * [ ] Google Analytics
  * [ ] Comment moderation
  * [ ] A nice looking custom theme
* [ ] Supporting Social Media accounts
  * [ ] Twitter  
  * [ ] Instagram
  * [ ] Facebook page
  * [ ] YouTube channel
* [ ] Automation, so your content spreads across channels (the Social Media accounts above)
* [ ] Extra security to protect it all
* [ ] Some extra, optional bits to make it look even more profesional! (however, this might not be free)

### Why do I need all of that?

Well, you might think that's a lot of stuff and probably your first thought is that you don't have time to manage all those accounts. Two commments about that: 

* You just worry about writing in your blog. All the other stuff will happen magically.
* Writing content is not easy, so you don't only need to commit yourself to find the time to do it. You also need to spread the word across all popular channels.

Okay, maybe these answers have brought even more questions. Like, magically how? What do I need a YouTube account for if I am not uploading videos? So to finally convince you to go ahead with all the steps. I will start with the "Automation" part, or at least I will explain it to you so you can see the benefits and forget about spending your day posting stuff on a thousand channels. 

**If you already know IFTTT, you can completely skip the following part**

# Automation, or "self-managed" Social Media accounts

Well, not really "self-managed", but almost! Would you like to publish something in your blog and having it posted automatically to Twitter and Facebook? How about posting videos on your blog that you've liked on YouTube? Or, how about those Instagram pictures? Would you like to have them also in your blog without doing anything at all? How about featuring those Instagram snaps you've liked in both your Facebook page and blog at once? That's automation, and it doesn't end here. You can add a hundred actions to keep it all connected and working together without effort.

Yes, it's possible, thanks to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com). This is what the free service can do for you:

> IFTTT is a web-based service that allows users to create chains of simple conditional statements, called "recipes", which are triggered based on changes to other web services such as Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Pinterest. IFTTT is an abbreviation of "If This Then That" (pronounced like "gift" without the "g").
An example "recipe" might consist of sending an e-mail message if the IFTTT user tweets using a certain hashtag. Or, if the user is tagged by someone on Facebook, then that photo will be added to the user's cloud-based photo archive.

IFTTT has brought a whole new way of doing things. It "makes the Internet work for you" (I think this was their marketing pitch when they started). Now it has evolved a lot, and you can even connect your twitter activity to your home's lights. It's just crazy.

But anyway, I hope you understand now that having a lot of Social Media accounts does not mean a lot of work, because you can set it all up to almost work on its own thanks to IFTTT.
