## How To Setup your Blog (and supporting Social Media accounts) For Free

This is a small but complete tutorial for those who want to create content and are interested in having an Internet presence. Whether you want to be found because you're selling something, or because you want to market yourself, there is no doubt that one mandatory step is to be active on Social Media, and create original content. You can write about your ideas, your professional experience and show your porfolio and products, and the easiest way to do that is having a website. Maybe it doesn't make sense to you to have a full blown web with pages and sections, so a blog is more fit to your goals.

If you don't know where to start, this tutorial will guide you through the whole process, step by step. By the time you have finished following these instructions, you'll have more than enough to start building your brand (personal or professional). 

Examples of blogs you can create:

* Personal blog
* Blog about your favorite topic: travelling, food, photography, movies, music, lifestyle, fashion, relationships, etc
* Promote your company and your products
* Product reviews

So let's start with a basic checklist of all the stuff I will cover. You don't need all of it, but since (almost) everything is for free, why not adding it? Of course, if it doesn't make sense to you, just ignore some of the tools/services I am suggesting. But don't do it because "you don't have the time" to maintain it all active and working. This is a one time setup, and we'll add some automation to connect all the dots. So whenever you create content, it will spread across your network, without effort. Actually, without doing anything at all! Don't be scared, it's SUPER easy to achieve this. You don't need any technical knowledge whatsoever to complete this guide.

## What will you have after finishing all the steps?

* Blog with..
  * Google Analytics
  * Comment moderation
  * A nice looking custom theme
* Supporting Social Media accounts
  * Twitter  
  * Instagram
  * Facebook page
  * YouTube channel
* Automation, so your content spreads across channels (the Social Media accounts above)
* Extra security to protect it all
* Some extra, optional bits to make it look even more profesional! (however, this might not be free)

### Why do I need all of that?

Well, you might think that's a lot of stuff and probably your first thought is that you don't have time to manage all those accounts. Two commments about that: 

* You just worry about writing in your blog. All the other stuff will happen magically.
* Writing content is not easy, so you don't only need to commit yourself to find the time to do it. You also need to spread the word across all popular channels.

Okay, maybe these answers have brought even more questions. Like, magically how? What do I need a YouTube account for if I am not uploading videos? So to finally convince you to go ahead with all the steps. I will start with the "Automation" part, or at least I will explain it to you so you can see the benefits and forget about spending your day posting stuff on a thousand channels.
