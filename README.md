## How To Setup your Blog (and supporting Social Media accounts) For Free

This is a small but complete tutorial for those who want to create content and are interested in having an Internet presence. Whether you want to be found because you're selling something, or because you want to market yourself, there is no doubt that one mandatory step is to be active on Social Media, and create original content. You can write about your ideas, your professional experience and show your porfolio and products, and the easiest way to do that is having a website. Maybe it doesn't make sense to you to have a full blown web with pages and sections, so a blog is more fit to your goals.

If you don't know where to start, this tutorial will guide you through the whole process, step by step. By the time you have finished following these instructions, you'll have more than enough to start building your brand (personal or professional). 

Examples of blogs you can create:

* Personal blog
* Blog about your favorite topic: travelling, food, photography, movies, music, lifestyle, fashion, relationships, etc
* Promote your company and your products
* Product reviews

So let's start with a basic checklist of all the stuff I will cover. You don't need all of it, but since (almost) everything is for free, why not adding it? Of course, if it doesn't make sense to you, just ignore some of the tools/services I am suggesting. But don't do it because "you don't have the time" to maintain it all active and working. This is a one time setup, and we'll add some automation to connect all the dots. So whenever you create content, it will spread across your network, without effort. Actually, without doing anything at all! Don't be scared, it's SUPER easy to achieve this. You don't need any technical knowledge whatsoever to complete this guide.
